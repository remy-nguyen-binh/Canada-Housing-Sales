# Canada Housing Sales Analysis with SQL
##

## Project Overview
The Canadian housing market is a dynamic and multifaceted sector that plays a crucial role in the country's economy. Understanding the nuances of this market requires a comprehensive analysis of various factors that influence housing prices and availability.

This project aims to provide insights into the Canadian housing market by leveraging SQL to analyze a rich dataset encompassing key attributes related to housing and demographics across different cities and provinces in Canada. 

By exploring trends and patterns within the data, we can gain a deeper understanding of the factors driving the housing market and make informed predictions about future developments.

## Description of the Dataset

The dataset utilized for this project offers a detailed snapshot of the Canadian housing market. It includes the following columns:
- City: The name of the city where the property is located.

- Price: The listing price of the property.

- Number of Bedrooms: The total number of bedrooms in the property.

- Number of Bathrooms: The total number of bathrooms in the property.

- Province: The province where the property is situated.

- Population: The population of the city, providing context on the size and density of the area.

- Latitude: The geographical latitude of the property, useful for spatial analysis and mapping.

- Longitude: The geographical longitude of the property, complementing the latitude for precise location mapping.

- Median Family Income: The median income of families in the city, which can be correlated with housing prices and affordability.

This dataset provides a comprehensive foundation for analyzing the housing market across Canada, enabling the exploration of regional disparities, the impact of demographic factors on housing prices, and the identification of trends over time.

Through this analysis, we aim to uncover valuable insights that can inform stakeholders, policymakers, and potential homebuyers.

## Data Cleaning
I checked the dataset for duplicates, missing values, and standardized data types. Then, I analyzed housing prices by calculating the average, minimum, maximum, and standard deviation. I also examined price per bedroom, correlations with median family income, average prices by bedrooms and bathrooms, and identified cities with the highest and lowest prices. Additionally, I assessed price distribution, ranked cities by average price within provinces, population, and price per capita.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, the analysis of Canada's housing prices reveals a clear trend: larger cities tend to have higher housing prices, while smaller cities generally offer more affordable housing options. This disparity can be attributed to several factors.

Larger cities typically provide greater economic opportunities with more jobs and higher salaries, increasing the demand for housing and consequently driving prices up. 

Additionally, big cities boast a wide range of amenities, cultural attractions, and services, making them highly desirable places to live, further intensifying housing demand. 

Foreign investment also plays a significant role, particularly in major cities, where it often inflates real estate prices. 

Furthermore, the number of bedrooms and bathrooms in a property also influences its price, reflecting varying preferences and needs of potential buyers in the housing market.
